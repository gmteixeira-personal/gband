## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Handshake
The first frame a client sends SHALL be a hello. The hello's payload SHALL begin with the client's protocol version, encoded the same way in every protocol version, followed by the client's terminal size. The first frame the server sends SHALL answer it. The server SHALL decode the leading version on its own, and compare it with its own version before it decodes anything that follows it. When the versions differ, the answer SHALL reject the client and carry the server's protocol version, whatever bytes follow the version, and the server SHALL then close the connection. When the versions are equal and the rest of the hello decodes, the answer SHALL accept the client and carry the server's protocol version. The leading version and the answer SHALL keep the same encoding in every later protocol version, so that two versions can always detect each other. The fields after the leading version MAY change in a later protocol version. This change defines protocol version 2.

#### Scenario: Matching versions
- **WHEN** a version 2 client sends its hello to a version 2 server
- **THEN** the server accepts it
- **AND** sends server info as its next frame, then the layout, then a snapshot of each pane

#### Scenario: Mismatched versions
- **WHEN** a version 1 client sends its hello to a version 2 server
- **THEN** the server rejects it with version 2 and closes the connection
- **AND** the server records the rejected version in its log and keeps running

#### Scenario: Later hello with other fields
- **WHEN** a client sends a hello frame holding version 3 followed by bytes that do not decode as a version 2 terminal size
- **THEN** the server rejects it with version 2 and closes the connection

#### Scenario: First frame is not a hello
- **WHEN** a client's first frame begins with version 2 but the rest does not decode as a hello
- **THEN** the server closes the connection without accepting it

#### Scenario: Empty first frame
- **WHEN** a client's first frame has an empty payload
- **THEN** the server closes the connection without answering
