## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Camera
Each workspace's camera SHALL be the strip position shown at the client terminal's left edge. A camera below 0 SHALL be allowed, and strip positions left of 0 SHALL be drawn empty. After every change of focus, of the layout or of the client's terminal width, the camera of the viewed workspace SHALL move by the configuration's `center_focused_column` policy, where the view spans from the camera to the camera plus the terminal's width.

Under `"never"`, the default:

- When the focused pane's column lies wholly inside the view, the camera SHALL not move.
- Otherwise, when the column is at least as wide as the terminal or starts left of the view, the camera SHALL move to the column's start.
- Otherwise, the camera SHALL move so that the column's end meets the terminal's right edge.

Under `"always"`, the camera SHALL centre the focused column: it SHALL move to the column's start less half the difference between the terminal's width and the column's width, rounded down. When the column is at least as wide as the terminal, the camera SHALL move to the column's start.

Under `"on-overflow"`, when focus moves from one column to another column C of the viewed workspace and the previously focused column is still in it, let S be the column next to C on the side the focus came from. When the span from the start of the leftmost of S and C to the end of the rightmost is no wider than the terminal, the camera SHALL move as under `"never"`. Otherwise it SHALL move as under `"always"`. Every other change SHALL move the camera as under `"never"`.

#### Scenario: Scroll right just enough
- **WHEN** the policy is `"never"`, the terminal is 80 columns wide, a workspace holds three columns of 40 cells at strip positions 0, 40 and 80, the camera is at 0 and focus moves from the second column to the third
- **THEN** the camera moves to 40

#### Scenario: Scroll back left
- **WHEN** the policy is `"never"`, the camera is at 40 in that workspace and focus moves to the first column
- **THEN** the camera moves to 0

#### Scenario: Visible column keeps the camera
- **WHEN** the policy is `"never"`, the camera is at 40 in that workspace and focus moves from the third column to the second
- **THEN** the camera stays at 40

#### Scenario: Column wider than the terminal
- **WHEN** the policy is `"never"`, the focused column starts at strip position 40 and is wider than the terminal
- **THEN** the camera moves to 40

#### Scenario: Always centre
- **WHEN** the policy is `"always"`, the terminal is 80 columns wide, a workspace holds three columns of 40 cells at strip positions 0, 40 and 80, and focus moves to the second column
- **THEN** the camera moves to 20

#### Scenario: Always centre the first column
- **WHEN** the policy is `"always"`, the terminal is 80 columns wide and the focused column is 40 cells wide at strip position 0
- **THEN** the camera is at -20 and the 20 cells left of the column are drawn empty

#### Scenario: On overflow, the pair fits
- **WHEN** the policy is `"on-overflow"`, the terminal is 80 columns wide, a workspace holds three columns of 40 cells at strip positions 0, 40 and 80, the camera is at 0 and focus moves from the second column to the third
- **THEN** the camera moves to 40

#### Scenario: On overflow, the pair does not fit
- **WHEN** the policy is `"on-overflow"`, the terminal is 80 columns wide, a workspace holds three columns of 53 cells at strip positions 0, 53 and 106, the camera is at 0 and focus moves from the first column to the second
- **THEN** the camera moves to 40

#### Scenario: On overflow after a width change
- **WHEN** the policy is `"on-overflow"`, the terminal is 80 columns wide, a workspace holds two columns of 40 cells at strip positions 0 and 40, the second is focused, the camera is at 0, and the second column grows to 48 cells
- **THEN** the camera moves to 8
