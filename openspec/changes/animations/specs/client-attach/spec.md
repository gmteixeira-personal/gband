## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Present the ribbon
After the handshake, the client SHALL take the terminal full screen in raw mode with bracketed paste enabled. It SHALL keep its own grid of every pane, as the wire-protocol capability defines, and its own view, as the layout-view capability defines. It SHALL draw only the viewed workspace, except during a workspace switch, when it SHALL draw the workspaces the animations capability places on screen.

Each pane SHALL be drawn in its tile, as the layout capability's tile geometry gives it for the screen area in the latest layout. A tile SHALL be drawn at its strip position less the viewed workspace's camera position, from the terminal's top row. While an animation runs, the tile's position and size, the camera and the workspace's top row SHALL be the drawn values the animations capability defines. At rest they equal the values above. Each tile SHALL show a one-cell border around the pane's grid, which is drawn from its top-left corner. The focused pane's border SHALL be drawn in a style distinct from the other borders.

A pane's grid MAY differ in size from its tile's interior while the server has not yet resized the pane. The border SHALL still follow the tile, at its drawn size while an animation runs. A grid larger than the interior SHALL be cut at the interior's right and bottom edges, and interior cells the grid does not cover SHALL be blank.

A tile that crosses the terminal's left, right or bottom edge SHALL be cut at that edge, and the part of the tile inside the terminal SHALL be drawn unchanged. No tile SHALL be resized to fit the terminal. A tile wholly outside the terminal SHALL NOT be drawn, and cells no tile covers SHALL be blank.

The terminal's cursor SHALL sit where the focused pane's cursor is. It SHALL be hidden when the focused pane hides its cursor, when that cell lies outside the terminal or outside the tile's interior, when no pane is focused, or while the animations capability hides it during motion.

#### Scenario: Two columns side by side
- **WHEN** the client's 80×24 terminal sets the screen area, and the viewed workspace holds two columns of width 1/2 with the second focused
- **THEN** the first tile fills screen columns 0 to 39 and the second fills 40 to 79, each with a border
- **AND** only the second tile's border has the focused style
- **AND** the cursor sits in the second tile

#### Scenario: Column clipped at the left edge
- **WHEN** the client's 80×24 terminal sets the screen area, the viewed workspace holds two columns of width 2/3, and the client focuses the second
- **THEN** the second tile fills screen columns 27 to 79
- **AND** screen columns 0 to 26 show the rightmost 27 columns of the first tile, without its left border

#### Scenario: Tile larger than the terminal
- **WHEN** the screen area is 120×40 because of another client, this client's terminal is 100×30, and the viewed workspace holds one column of width 1/2
- **THEN** this client draws the top 30 rows of the 60-column tile
- **AND** the tile's bottom border is not drawn

#### Scenario: Empty workspace
- **WHEN** the client views an empty workspace
- **THEN** the screen is blank and the cursor is hidden

#### Scenario: Grid smaller than its tile
- **WHEN** a pane's tile is 50×30 and its grid is still 38×22
- **THEN** the border is drawn around the 50×30 tile
- **AND** the grid fills the top-left 38×22 cells of the interior, and the rest of the interior is blank

#### Scenario: Grid larger than its tile
- **WHEN** a pane's tile is 40×24 and its grid is still 48×28
- **THEN** the interior shows the grid's top-left 38×22 cells
- **AND** the border is drawn unbroken around the 40×24 tile

#### Scenario: Mid-scroll frame
- **WHEN** the camera is drawn at 20 while it scrolls toward 40, and the viewed workspace holds three columns of 40 cells
- **THEN** the second tile fills screen columns 20 to 59
- **AND** the cursor is hidden
